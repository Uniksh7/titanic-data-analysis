# 🛳️ Titanic Data Analysis Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for data analysis and **Power BI** for interactive data visualization.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Titanic-Analysis.ipynb**  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
  
- **Titanic.pbix**  
  A Power BI dashboard that visualizes key patterns and survival statistics from the dataset.

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Explore and understand the demographics of Titanic passengers.
- Analyze survival rates based on features like:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age group
  - Embarkation port
  - Fare paid
  - Family size
- Present findings using interactive charts and dashboards.

---

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- DAX (for custom calculations)
- Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset/code) or the dataset is directly available.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)

- Survival rate breakdown by gender, class, and embarkation port
- Passenger distribution by fare and age
- Interactive filters for custom exploration
- Heatmap-style matrix for survival patterns
- Scatter plot: Fare vs. Age (colored by survival)

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Women and children had a significantly higher survival rate.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in third class.
- Fare and age showed some correlation with survival when analyzed together.
- Most passengers boarded at Southampton (S), but survival rates varied by port.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code to view the Python EDA.
3. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to interact with the dashboard.
